      Dilpasand was established on a very small scale by Haji Ahmed Mian in the year 1957. But as a product of our untiring efforts, desire for the highest quality, professional dedication, selection of the finest ingredients, best skilled labor and innovations in the mode of packing, Dilpasand progressed remarkably and blossomed to its present standing of unmatched prestige.
